<h2 style="color:yellow;"> Bio of me: </h2>
<p style= "color:yellow;">
While growing up in Baltimore I would always hear people talk about wanting to be a rapper but I was never interested in music. My passion ever since I was in elementary school was always technology. My first experience at engineering was when I was in a program called Gear Up for Success. When I signed up for the robotics program, I had no idea what I was going to do but when I saw the robotics kits my eyes lit up with excitement and I knew from there that I wanted to be an engineer. In my opinion, engineering wasn't limited to rules and you could try many different ways to solve a solution. This had increased my desire to be an engineer because I was excited to know that I have the possibility to change the world around me and make this world an easier place to live in through technology.
